## ðŸ”§ Update: Revised PCB Model

The previous version of the PCB had the following issues in the schematic and layout:

- Two decoupling capacitors were connected only to the VDD pin, leaving VDDH unpowered.
- A pull-up resistor between VDD and 3.3V was missing, which is required for proper operation.
- PCB routing was not optimal and needed to be revised to accommodate the above corrections.

These issues have been addressed in the new version:

- VDDH is now correctly powered via decoupling capacitors.
- A pull-up resistor has been added between VDD and 3.3V.
- The PCB layout has been completely re-routed to reflect the updated schematic.

This corrected model replaces the previous version and ensures proper functionality according to the component datasheet and design guidelines.
