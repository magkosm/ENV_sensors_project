## ðŸ”§ Update: Redone PCB Model

    I have redone the electrical scheme and PCB for be sure all is their place, also I done the routes in PCB manually because auto routes was doing weird things.

This corrected model replaces the previous version and ensures proper functionality according to the component datasheet and design guidelines.
