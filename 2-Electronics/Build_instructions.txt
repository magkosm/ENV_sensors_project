ENV sensor build instructions :

This short document give guidlines on how to build and assembke the ENV sensors.
Theses sensors are easy to assemble but the wiring can be a bit tricky and repetitive to do. 
As a futur improvment I may suggest to create a dedicated pcb. I didn't perceived this way to enable futur students to easily replace a module in case a sensor broke up.
Further more the commonly available 2.54mm dupont connector were to big to be used to connect the sensors to the esp32.

Parts list for one sensor:

1x TSL2591	                	
1x SSD1306 128x32 oled	
1x ESP32 D1 mini	        	
1x USB A socket	        
1x BME280-3,3	        	
1x SGP40	                	
2x M2-12 screws	        	
9x M2-5 screws	    	
1x SCD40	            	
1x Push button
1x 4x1 2.54mm dupont connector (male and female)
1x 6x4 holes perf board

You will also need 24 and 28 AWG wire for the electrical connexions, heat shrink and double sided tape.						

3D prints for one sensor :

- Bottom.stl
- Top.stl
- Bnt.stl
- Lock_plate_oled.stl
- Lock_plate_scd.stl

For the print settings, Nothing special :
- 2 perimeters
- 20% infil
- support for the Bottom and Lock plates


Electrical wiring :

1 - We will start by creating the central I2C bus distribution pcb.
For that we will need the perf board and the 28 AWG wire.

Start by cutting a piece of perf board that has 4 by 6 holes. You may have to file the sides to make it fit in the top part of the enclosure.
Cut 6 sets of 4 wire of about 50mm
You can twist each set for an easier manipulation.
Solder each wire to on hole in the perf board. Use one color wire per row.
Once all the wire are soldered on the perf board, join all the point in a row together using solder bridges. 


2 - Wire trimming

Assemble the sensors and the screen in their corresponding emplacement. Secure them with the screws. 
WARNING Don't tighthen to much the screws ont he sgp40, the enclosure wall are really thin and you may create a hole.

Once every sensor is in place, put the pcb you just created in it's emplacement. Then start cutting the wires to the right lenght. 
Before hand choose a color for the 4 pins of each sensors:

-GND
-VCC (3.3 v !!!)
-SCL
-SDA

Be sure to match the color with the label on each I2C devices !

Also prepare wires to go between the ESP32 and the dupont connector.

3 - Soldering

Once all the wire are cut to size you can solder them to the corresponding pcb pads.
Also solder the wires to the duponts connectors.

Here is the correspondance between ESP32 pins and I2C lines :

-GND --> GND
-VCC --> 3V3
-SCL --> IO22
-SDA --> IO21

WARNING : Make sure to plug the dupont connector in the right way, I would recommand to mark the two halves with correction fluid.

You can also wire the USB-A port to the ESP32. I would recommend to check the port pinout before soldering it.
As of today the data lines of the usb port aren't used but it could be nice to wire them as we can enable this functionnality in software.
